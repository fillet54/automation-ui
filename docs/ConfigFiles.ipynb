    "We propose shifting the responsibility of maintaining config files from the \n",
    "OFP team to end users. This change aims to address the tedious and error-prone\n",
    "process of users feeding back changes to the development team and waiting for\n",
    "the team to provide updated config files with each release. This process \n",
    "contains a significant lag and relies on users to merge config files, which can\n",
    "lead to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the OFP team will no longer be responsible for maintaining config files,\n",
    "they will still play a role in migrating existing files to new versions. \n",
    "Additionally, a facility for generating a brand new set of configuration files\n",
    "will be provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The migration process will follow a similar approach to database schema \n",
    "migrations. Config files will be processed through a sequence of migrations, \n",
    "each bringing them closer to the target version. This approach avoids the need \n",
    "for a single migration that could require a lot of unique migrations each time\n",
    "a new OFP version is released. Instead, at most, we will only need a single \n",
    "new migration for each OFP version.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, the migration process should be seamless and require no input \n",
    "from users. However, there may be some cases where user input is required, \n",
    "such as when a new configuration field is added and the user needs to specify\n",
    "its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this proposed approach should streamline the config file management\n",
    "process and reduce errors, while still providing a role for the OFP team in\n",
    "ensuring smooth migrations."
