    "> I believe that the time is ripe for significantly better documentation of programs, \n",
    "> and that we can best achieve this by considering programs to be works of literature. \n",
    "> Hence, my title: __\"Literate Programming.\"__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of \n",
    "> imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate \n",
    "> rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an essayist, whose main \n",
    "> concern is with exposition and excellence of style. Such an author, with thesaurus in \n",
    "> hand, chooses the names of variables carefully and explains what each variable means.\n",
    "> He or she strives for a program that is comprehensible because its concepts have been\n",
    "> introduced in an order that is best for human understanding, using a mixture of formal \n",
    "> and informal methods that reinforce each other.\n",

    "This module provides the foundation which, by design, is to be extended by test developers and\n",
    "therefore documentation is a must. Developing the library alongside its documentation will ensure\n",
    "that the documentation and motivations stay in-sync with the implementation. Additionally\n",
    "it should serve to provide an even deeper understanding on how the framework works potentially\n",
    "opening up more rich extensions than would be possible without.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How These Notebooks work\n",
    "This library is built up from a set of ipython notebooks. To faciliate this we need\n",
    "a way to use code from one notebook in another. The problem is relatively simple. \n",
    "To be able to import the code from other notebooks we've simply used the code from \n",
    "the [jupyter documentation][1]. With this we can easily import other notebooks as \n",
    "regular python modules. To do so we first must install, in each notebook, the loader\n",
    "into our current environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import nbloader\n",
    "nbloader.install_loader()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After this any notebook can be imported as if it were a normal python module. For example\n",
    "if there is a notebook named `my_resuable_functions.ipynb` which contained a function named\n",
    "`do_something_useful`. From another notebook we simply could do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from my_resuable_functions import do_something_useful\n",
    "\n",
    "do_something_useful()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note is that notebooks must be named with a valid module name. I find this a little\n",
    "restrictive especially if our notebook names indicate some type of reading order. For example if\n",
    "we wanted to indicate heading level in a notebook name we might come up with\n",
    "`_01_introduction.ipynb`. While that is a valid module name its hardly nice to look at. Instead\n",
    "I would prefer it was `01 - Introduction.ipynb`. This is not a valid module name but python does\n",
    "have a mechanism to handle module names with spaces or dashes. That mechanism is the `__import__`\n",
    "function. While this is usually frowned upon I think in this case it's not too much of a a problem. \n",
    "In fact I might consider it useful to distinguish notebook imports from regular module imports. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This does not work\n",
    "import 01 - Introduction\n",
    "```\n",
    "instead we can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "introduction = __import__('01 - Introduction')\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "    Note: There still is a limitation in that you cannot include `.` in the name. For example\n",
    "    `01. Introduction.ipynb` would not be a valid name as the `.` is used by python to descend \n",
    "    into modules.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance this looks to be all we need except when you realize theres a lot that goes into\n",
    "notebooks other than the code we want to reuse in other places. Specifically cells that are purely \n",
    "examples or tests to futher explain something. To handle this we updated the loader to only evaluate \n",
    "cells that are start with an export comment. Any cell that starts with `#export` will be evaluated\n",
    "and exported to the module.\n",
