    "not easy and writing a framework that is adopted is nearly impossible. I hope\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "We need automated tests. The tests will be written for both new and old \n",
    "code and ideally run on each commit. The tests should make it easy to \n",
    "determine the source of an bug (either with the system or the test). Unit \n",
    "tests are usually the preferred choice here for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fast to execute\n",
    "2. Isolated to a single unit\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale for \\#1 is simple. The faster the tests the easier it is to run through\n",
    "them all for each commit. \\#2 I believe is a bit trickier to understand. First isolating\n",
    "to a single unit is what makes the tests fast but it's more than that. Isolated to a \n",
    "single unit also means that when a test fails it almost certainly due to the unit under\n",
    "tests and not due to some unrelated unit. So both these reasons certaintly\n",
    "support our problem statement. But there are some disadvantages for unit tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It takes time to write test cases.\n",
    "2. It's difficult to write tests for legacy code.\n",
    "3. Tests require a lot of time for maintenance.\n",
    "4. It can be challenging to test GUI code.\n",
    "5. Unit testing can't catch all errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\#1 and \\#3 are going to be a problem with any type of automated test strategy. \\#4 is\n",
    "not going to directly apply to our target system. That leaves us with \\#2 and \\#5. \n",
    "\\#2 is going to work directly against our goal for writing tests for our current system.\n",
    "The majority of the tests that will be written will be for legacy code. And I believe \n",
    "the style of our legacy code will make it even harder to write unit tests for them.\n",
    "The legacy code is written in large units that will require large setup clauses that\n",
    "ultimately will couple the tests to the code which will undoubtably lead to large\n",
    "occurances of false positives. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\#5 is a tradeoff of unit tests vs other tests. To get fast isolated tests you give up \n",
    "catching errors that come about when the system is integrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am going to suggest that unit tests are not the right choice for most of our code base \n",
    "and instead suggest we do most testing at whitebox functional level. Im not sure if this \n",
    "is a real description for testing but essentially we will test the full system running but\n",
    "allow us more freedom in how we invoke a test and determine the result. This is not to\n",
    "say the framework shouldn't allow unit tests but it won't be the immediate focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! The real problem statement for the framework is here !!!\n",
    "Most testing frameworks focus on synchronous \n",
    "\n",
    "To reimagine Requirement Verification Tests (RVTs) moving from\n",
    "an imperative style to a declarative one. What do we mean by imperative vs declarative?\n",
    "In their current form RVTs describe in extreme detail how to execute a test. \n",
    "They describe how to setup and how to configure the simulation, how to setup any \n",
    "preconditions, and when to restart a simulation. With all this detail it is usually\n",
    "difficult to clearly see which lines are the true test and which lines are purely\n",
    "setup. Additionally because starting a simulation is usually expensive tests are\n",
    "organized to reuse a simulation which couples tests together in unspecified ways. This\n",
    "means that when a test fails it can be hard to trace why. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally since each test procedure specifies the entire lifecyle of a test\n",
    "it is hard to combine execution of tests. Authors sometimes will combine a few\n",
    "tests into one to optimize test startup but it leaves a lot to be desired. \n",
    "Specifically a lot of these tests can be (or should be) run in parallel as that\n",
    "usually how a system will ultimately be run in production. The current RVT format\n",
    "provides no facilities for allowing for parallel test execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "A declarative approach on the other hand would specify the conditions necessary for the\n",
    "test to be valid and let the testing apparatus to either figure out how to \n",
    "setup those conditions or to recognize when those conditions are valid and execute \n",
    "the test. \n",
    "\n",
    "This should provide atleast 3 immediate benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Quicker test execution both in development and batches as the simulation in \n",
    "   most cases will not have to be restarted.\n",
    "2. Tests that are not coupled\n",
    "3. Clearer tests. \n",

    "## Requirement Verification Test (RVT) Background\n",
    "This section will be a brief introduction of the current in use test framework called RVT. RVTs are the name given to the procedures executed by the Automation-V2 executor. RVT is a line-based, plaintext format with a keyword driven like syntax. \n",
    "\n",
    "RVTs are executed line by line using shell like syntax (i.e bash). This means the first space delimited token is the `command` and the rest are arguments to that `command`. In Automation-V2 the `command` is simply the name of a registered `BuildingBlock` which has a defined interface for (1) determining if it can accept the listed arguments and (2) a method to execute the `BuildingBlock`. When executed, a block will return either a `pass` or `fail` result. On `pass` the Automation-V2 executor will continue to the next line. On `fail` the framework will immediately stop the procedure execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "One last important concept of RVTs is there exists an `Observer` interface that allows listeners to register for execution events. An example of an event would be the `TestStart` and `TestCompletion` events. `Observers` allow for such things as TestReports to be created in a variety of formats. \n",
